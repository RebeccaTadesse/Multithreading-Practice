This implements client-server multithreading in order for multiple clients to interact with a 
server and simultaneously edit a drawing.

## To Run:
Open in your preferred IDE, and run the main class Editor.java

A graphical editor should open, providing you with the option to draw shapes (ellipses, rectangles, lines), move them, recolor them et cetera. To test multithreading capabilities, run Editor.java a second time. As you edit one graphical editor, the other should reflect that change concurrently.
